Given head of a singly linked list. Find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

Output: 5
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 5, as there are 5 nodes present in it.
Input: head: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 7, as there are 7 nodes present in it.
Constraints:
1  ≤  number of nodes  ≤  4*104
1  ≤  node->data  ≤  103 */
