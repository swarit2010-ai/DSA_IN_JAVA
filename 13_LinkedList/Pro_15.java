/* Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 49.37%Submissions: 339K+Points: 2Average Time: 20m
Given the head of a sorted singly linked list, remove all duplicate nodes so that each element appears only once. The resulting linked list should remain sorted.

Note: Try to solve the problem without using extra space.

Examples:

Input: Head: 2->2->4->5
Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: In the given linked list 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.
Input: Head: 2->2->2->2->2
Output: 2

Explanation: In the given linked list  2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2, 2 is the only element and is repeated 5 times. So we need to remove any four 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes, data of nodes ≤ 105 */
