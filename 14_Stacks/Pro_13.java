Implement a Stack using a Linked List. The stack has dynamic size and can grow until memory is available.
The Stack must support the following operations:

(i) push(x): Insert an element x at the top of the stack.
(ii) pop(): Remove the element from the top of the stack.
(iii) peek(): Return top element if not empty, else -1.
(iv) isEmpty(): Return true if the stack is empty else return false.
(v) size(): Return the number of elements currently in the stack.

There will be a sequence of queries queries[][] in numeric form: 

1 x : Call push(x)
2: Call pop()
3: Call peek()
4: Call isEmpty()
5: Call size()
Implement only the functions push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size. The driver code handles input and output.

Examples:

Input: q = 7, queries[][] = [[1, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [3], [2], [5], [4]]
Output: [4, 2, false]
Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:
push(5): Insert 5 at the top of the stack.
push(3): Insert 3 at the top of the stack.
push(4): Insert 4 at the top of the stack.
peek(): Return the top element i.e 4.
pop(): Remove the top element 4 from the stack.
size(): Stack contains 2 elements return 2.
isEmpty(): Stack is not empty return false.
Input: q = 4, queries[][] = [[4], [3], [1, 10], [5]]
Output: [true, -1, 1]
Explanation: Queries on queue are as follows:
isEmpty(): Stack is empty return true.
peek(): Stack is empty return -1.
push(10): Insert 10 at the top of the stack.
size(): Stack contains 1 element return 1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of query ≤ 103
0 ≤ x ≤ 105 */
